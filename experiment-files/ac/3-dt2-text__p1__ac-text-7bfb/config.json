Do not create a crease.</li>\n  <li>Place the top card in the middle of the deck.</li>\n  <li>Keep your left thumb pressing on the top of the deck to not reveal the second bent card.</li>\n  <li>Transfer your deck into a side grip and keep the top card flat with your left thumb and middle finger.</li>\n  <li>Release the pressure with your fingers to make the top card pop.</li>\n</ol>"
